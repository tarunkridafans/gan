        <p>
          Charities on the Waste No Food app receive high-quality meals from
          restaurants, convention centers, hotels, stadiums, and grocery stores
          in their communities. Charity users receive push notifications on the
          Waste No Food app whenever food in their area becomes available. They
          claim food only if theyâ€™re able to serve it to their clients. They
          then pick it up or assign a volunteer food runner to pick it up. The
          Waste No Food app helps charities prioritize volunteer time and reduce
          money on food budgets: they can divert savings to other programmatic
          expenses.
